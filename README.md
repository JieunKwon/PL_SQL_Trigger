    WHEN (NEW.ID > 0) 
    DECLARE 
       sal_diff number; 
    BEGIN 
       sal_diff := :NEW.salary  - :OLD.salary; 
       dbms_output.put_line('Old salary: ' || :OLD.salary); 
       dbms_output.put_line('New salary: ' || :NEW.salary); 
       dbms_output.put_line('Salary difference: ' || sal_diff); 
    END;
