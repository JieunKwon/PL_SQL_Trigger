# PL/SQL Trigger


Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some events occur. 

Triggers are written to be executed in response to any of the following events âˆ’

A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE)

A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE, ALTER, or DROP)

A database operation (SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, or SHUTDOWN)


Benefits of Triggers
----

 - Generating some derived column values automatically

 - Enforcing referential integrity

 - Event logging and storing information on table access

 - Auditing

 - Synchronous replication of tables

 - Imposing security authorizations

 - Preventing invalid transactions


Create Trigger
------

    CREATE [OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_name  
    {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }  
    {INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE}  
    [OF col_name]  
    ON table_name  
    [REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n]  
    [FOR EACH ROW]  
    WHEN (condition)   
    DECLARE 
       Declaration-statements 
    BEGIN  
       Executable-statements 
    EXCEPTION 
       Exception-handling-statements 
    END; 
    

[REFERENCING OLD / NEW ]

 new - refer value for INSERT and UPDATE
   
 old - old values for UPDATE and DELETE

[CAN NOT create more than one trigger for the same event on the same table]

Example
-----

    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER display_salary_changes 
    BEFORE DELETE OR INSERT OR UPDATE ON customers 
    FOR EACH ROW 
    WHEN (NEW.ID > 0) 
    DECLARE 
       sal_diff number; 
    BEGIN 
       sal_diff := :NEW.salary  - :OLD.salary; 
       dbms_output.put_line('Old salary: ' || :OLD.salary); 
       dbms_output.put_line('New salary: ' || :NEW.salary); 
       dbms_output.put_line('Salary difference: ' || sal_diff); 
    END; 
    / 

-> The above trigger will fire before any DELETE or INSERT or UPDATE operation on the table. 

-> if trigger fired, it will display the following result 

Old salary: 1500 

New salary: 2000 

Salary difference: 500
